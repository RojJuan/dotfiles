This repo is mostly for me to easily replicate my neovim and i3 configs elsewhere

Feel free to use tho!

## Neovim

To use the Neovim config you will need a few things

- Rust language installed
- Go language installed
- Node and npm installed

This is so you can download the packages for the 3 languages (Go, Rust and Javascript)

## i3

My i3 config is about to change as i am switching distros and will most likely use Sway in the future.

The config will be fully working for me, but you will need to do some changes yourself in order to work.

As this config is pretty much the config from [Tester Tech's videoÂ¸](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hz3plDLZ3kI&t=669s), i reccommend that you go watch his tutorial on his config and how it works:
